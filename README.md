# Emblem of Fire

Emblem of Fire is a Fire Emblem clone under the [Stardust engine](https://github.com/NT-Bourgeois-Iridescence-Technologies/Stardust-Engine). The target platforms are PSP and PC (Windows, macOS, Linux) primarily, but support for PS2 and PS Vita is expected later. The game is currently not in a playable state; this README will be updated as the game progresses.

## Planned Features

- A smooth 60FPS Fire Emblem-like experience across all platforms
- Crisp 2D "pixel art" style similar to the GBA Fire Emblem games
- Orchestrated soundtrack complimenting the retro aesthetic
- Singleplayer gameplay

## Potential Features
### Notice: There is NO guarantee these features will be implemented at any stage. These are ONLY under consideration at this point in time.

- Online, player versus player multiplayer (cross-platform) - bring your teams online and may the best tactician win!
- Directly transfer your save data between your PSP and your other devices! 

## FAQ

**Q:** When will this be ready?

**A:** There is no time window for when this game may come to fruition. I'd like to get this game into a playable state someday, but who's to say where this project will end up? My current goal is to produce a proof of concept, and that is my only focus at this time. A campaign or multiplayer can come later, but until I have a playable proof of concept, I won't waste time planning those things. Depending on the response to the proof of concept, and potential interest/support, I would be happy to flesh the project out into a full game. Of course, there are so many variables before we reach that point that it is simply impossible to say when or if we will reach this point.

**Q:** Will this be an original game?

**A:** Yes, this will be an entirely new game. However, at this point in time, we can't say whether the story will be set in the Fire Emblem universe or in an original universe due to questions regarding copyright.
