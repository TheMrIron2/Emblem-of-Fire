# OST

 This folder contains the original high quality source for all in-game music, using ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) in the M4A container exported directly from my DAW, Logic Pro X. The music used in-game will likely be of a lower bitrate to conserve memory on PSP, the primary target platform. 

This has not been finalised and is subject to review, but for the time being - until memory is completely planned out - I am keeping high quality mixes here and I will see what I can do in-game.
